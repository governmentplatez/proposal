# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

## I can't think of a good title at the moment

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

## A dating sim with programming languages as anime girls 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

## Like a lot of visual novels, you get to choose what to say to the girl you're on a date with, there will possible be some sort of guage on the screen to indicate how your date is going (similar to how yakuza does this when you go to a hostess club)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

## one ending for each character 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## Get at least 1-2 good/bad endings done  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## At least more than an hour of gameplay

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

## I would need to learn how to use renpy since this is my first time using it.  I would probably have to research visual novel development and maybe ways of writing datesims since I have not played any in the past. I would also have to research on how to make character sprites, a lot of this is something that I have never done before. This entire project will be a learning experience for me because I have never done anything like this before.
